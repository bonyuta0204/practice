# Espa単ol CLI Dictionary

## Introduction

Espa単ol CLI brings the power of a Spanish dictionary directly to your command-line interface, making it easier than ever for developers, language learners, and enthusiasts to access Spanish word definitions without leaving the terminal. This tool is designed to be simple, fast, and efficient, fitting seamlessly into your workflow.

## Features

- **Lightweight and Fast:** Quickly lookup Spanish words directly from your CLI.
- **Easy to Install:** Get up and running with just a few commands.
- **Customizable Dictionary Path:** Use the default dictionary or specify your own path for personalized word lists.

## Installation

Before using Espa単ol CLI, you must first install it. Installation instructions will be specific to your operating system and setup. After installation, you'll need to build the dictionary database.

## Usage

### Building the Dictionary

Before your first lookup, build the dictionary database with:

```bash
espanol build --path <optional_path_to_dictionary_file>
```

- `--path` is optional. If not specified, Espa単ol CLI uses the default path: `~/.espanol/dictionary.db`.

### Lookup Words

To find the definition of a Spanish word:

```bash
espanol lookup <word> --path <optional_path_to_dictionary_file>
```

- If `--path` is not specified, it defaults to `~/.espanol/dictionary.db`.
