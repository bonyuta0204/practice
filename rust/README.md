# Rust Directory
This directory contains Rust projects and coding challenges.

## Structure

- **async_rust**: Contains examples and practice code for understanding and using Rust's asynchronous programming features.
- **leetcode**: Holds solutions to various problems from LeetCode.

## Getting Started with Rust

1. Ensure you have the Rust toolchain installed. If not, you can install it from [the official site](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Navigate to the project directory you're interested in (`async_rust` or `leetcode`).
3. Inside each project directory, you can build and run the code. For example:

For `async_rust`:
```bash
cd async_rust
cargo run
```

For `leetcode` problems:
```bash
cd leetcode
cargo run --bin problem_name # Replace 'problem_name' with the specific problem you want to run
```

## Usage

- The `async_rust` directory is structured for practicing and understanding asynchronous code in Rust. It contains a `main.rs` where the async examples are illustrated.
- The `leetcode` directory is organized with separate `.rs` files for each problem. Use the `cargo run` command as described above to compile and run individual problems.

## Note

This is a personal practice space for improving Rust programming skills. Feel free to explore and use the code as a reference for your own learning journey.

Happy coding!
